  flex-grow: 1: The flex item can grow to take up any available space in the flex container. The 1 value means it will take up a proportion of the available space relative to other flex items with a flex-grow value.

  flex-shrink: 1: The flex item can shrink if necessary to fit into the container. The 1 value means it will shrink in proportion to other flex items with a flex-shrink value.

  flex-basis: 0%: The initial size of the flex item before space is distributed according to flex-grow and flex-shrink. A 0 value means the item will start with zero width and grow based on the remaining space.
